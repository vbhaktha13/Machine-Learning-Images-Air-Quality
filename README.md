A large number of studies have examined the short-term
associations between air pollution and morbidity and
mortality outcomes, but a surge in the increasing number
of these studies has occurred over the last two decades. The
most common study design is time-series analysis, comparing
day-to-day fluctuations of community average air pollution
and corresponding fluctuations in the daily citywide aggregate counts of morbidity or mortality, while adjusting for
temporal trends and weather effects. The basic modeling
concept goes back to several studies conducted in London,
England in the 1950s and 1960s (e.g., Scott, 1958; Martin
and Bradley, 1960) in which attempts were made to
quantitatively link particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide
(SO2) and daily deaths, adjusting for temporal trends.
Several studies also reported associations between PM and
mortality in the U.S. in the 1970s (e.g., Schimmel and
Greenburg, 1972; Schimmel and Murawski, 1976; Schimmel,
1978), using increasingly more elaborate techniques. The
1980s brought a re-evaluation of the London data sets by
several researchers to quantify the relationship between air
pollution and mortality (Ware et al., 1981; Mazumdar et al.,
1982; Shumway et al., 1983; Schwartz and Marcus, 1986;
Thurston et al., 1989). Most of the above studies focused on
PM and SO2, the ‘‘classic’’ primary air pollution products of
coal burning. In addition to the main objective of quantifying
the exposure–response relationships, the relative importance
of PM and SO2 was often examined in these studies
