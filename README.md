**ML Air Quality project**
Air quality monitoring is conducted with the aim of protecting public health. Numerous air contaminants have been found to have harmful effects on human health. The air
quality in cities varies, due to concentrations of particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) and 10 micrometers (PM10),
nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), and sulfur dioxide (SO2),
from emission sources including vehicle exhaust, manufacturing operations, and chemical
facilities, among other sources.
A major challenge in air quality data management is determining how to deal with
missing data values. Missing information in data sets occurs for multiple reasons, such
as impaired equipment, insufficient sampling frequency, hardware problems, and human
error. Incomplete data sets affect the applicability of specific analyses, such as receptor
modeling, which generally requires a complete data matrix. The occurrence of missing
data, no matter how infrequent, can bias findings on the relationships between air contaminants and health outcomes. 
Incomplete data matrices may provide outcomes that vary significantly, compared to the results from complete data sets.
To gain a more complete data set, researchers must decide whether to discard or impute (i.e., substitute for) missing data.
Ignoring missing values is typically not warrant
